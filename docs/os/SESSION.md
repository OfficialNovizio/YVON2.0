## Open Decisions (not yet resolved)
- [ ] Auth provider — Supabase Auth built-in vs custom OAuth?

## How to Update This File
At the end of each session, the executing agent:
1. Moves "Active Right Now" to the top of the sessions table (newest first)
2. Fills in Date, Agent(s), Task, Outcome, Next Step
3. Drops the oldest row if there are already 5 entries
4. Writes a new "Active Right Now" section if a task is still in progress
